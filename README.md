# By A Thread

## By Sharon Ogbonna
A Full Stack (MERN) Application with CRUD functionality. This project was inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) an organizational app. I named By A Thread because sometimes you feel like that all that is holding your life together and thats okay. Hopefully this app can help with that. This repo works best with [this repo backend](https://github.com/Sharonogbonna/project3-backend). This app as has size responsive styling - a big focus of mine - a '90s' vibe.

## Unsolved Issues

- Need to redo submit buttons for consistency, to either say edit, create, or all to submit

## Future Enhancements

One goal is to make a user login so that you can only see the information that you add. Another goal is to make some edits to the dashboard so its not as stagnant, as well as adding the whether or music.
