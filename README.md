# By A Thread

## By Sharon Ogbonna
A Full Stack (MERN) Application with CRUD functionality. This project was inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), an organizational app. I named it By A Thread because sometimes you feel like that all that is holding your life together and that is okay. Hopefully this app can help with that. This repo works best with [this backend repo](https://github.com/Sharonogbonna/project3-backend). This app has size responsive styling - a big focus of mine - and a '90s' arcade design and color scheme.

## Unsolved Issues

- Need to redo submit buttons for consistency, to either say edit, create, or all to say submit

## Future Enhancements

One goal is to make a user login so that you can only see the information that you add. Another goal is to make some edits to the dashboard so it's not as stagnant.  Along with this, I would like to add a weather and music section to the dashboard as well.
