# By A Thread

## By Sharon Ogbonna
A Full Stack (MERN) Application with CRUD functionality. This project was inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) an organizational app. I named By A Thread because sometimes you feel like that all that is holding your life together and thats okay. Hopefully this app can help with that. This repo works best with [this repo backend](https://github.com/Sharonogbonna/project3-backend). This app as has size responsive styling, which was a big focus of mine.
